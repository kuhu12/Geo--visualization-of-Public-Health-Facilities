# Geo--visualization-of-Public-Health-Facilities
The project implements Choropleth Maps to visualize Chhattisgarh's Public Health Facilities


Each year major part of a countryâ€™s wealth is spent on public health. The government organizations keep daily records of large volumes of public health-related data resulting in voluminous multivariate dataset. These datasets are spatially varying which poses a challenge for proper analysis. These datasets cannot be ignored since these are potentially useful for decision makers and public health policy makers to understand the past occurrences, monitor the present, and predict the future of the health scenario in a country. Currently available visualization tools for such datasets fail to give clear insights on multivariate comparisons and spatial distribution of public health resources at the same time. The work propounds an ingenious use of geo-visualization for management of Chhattisgarh public health-care. The organizational aspects of public health resources in Chhattisgarh state are studied with an intention to recognize the districts that stands aberrant regarding availability and accessibility of public health centers for the population. The outcomes aids in decision making for distribution of available resources by health-care officials. Additionally, the cardinal methodological contribution of the work is the introduction of advanced visualization techniques of Choropleth Maps that could be applied to a multitude of fields.
